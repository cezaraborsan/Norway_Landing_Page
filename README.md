TRAVELx Landing Page

This landing page was designed and built as part of my portfolio using HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript. The design was inspired by a project I found on Figma Community(https://www.figma.com/file/VHzI6vlD3QaxmLxaEJ4xy3/Travel-Landing-Page-Free-Community), and I made it my own with a flexible approach to the layout and content.

As one of my first projects using SASS, I wanted to challenge myself and push my skills further. I also used the Swiper library for the slider, which allowed me to gain experience with a useful tool for future projects.

While the landing page was designed for a travel website, it can easily be modified for other domains due to its adaptable design. This project not only showcases my technical abilities but also my creativity and attention to detail. I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it.
